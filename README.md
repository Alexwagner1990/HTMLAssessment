## HTML Assessment

#### How To Run This project

...it's just an HTML file. Open it in a browser. Bam. Done.

assessment.html is where the action is. thankyou.html opens after submitting the form.

#### Project Description

This assessment is a pretty basic demonstration of some HTML formatting, like tables, text formatting, lists, and forms. The assessment does not implement CSS styles or HTML classes.

#### Lessons Learned

I don't have much experience with HTML - I think I wrote maybe one HTML table over the course of my employment history - but I found that HTML is pretty intuitive and easy to pick up. Granted, the assessment was pretty simple by design, but HTML elements and flows were quite straightforward. For instance, I didn't immediately know offhand how to put a paragraph of text in a block quote, but a quick Google search later and I find that the tag command is just "\<blockquote\>". To make the text paragraph the block quote, just surround it in tags. Even without knowing the exact implementation technique, HTML was straightforward enough for me to basically Google the syntax and intuit the implementation.

My history with HTML includes lots of Googling to figure out the exact way to format a border or make a header larger, and at least for the time being it looks like I'll have to continue to Google some of the syntax - I'm sure it will become easier over time as I do HTML more, but for now I'm having a hard time remembering the specific syntax to do anything beyond making a basic list or form.

I'm starting to see places where Java would interact with HTML. It wasn't particularly clear to me how, for instance, Java would interact with a web page. I knew that most web sites used HTML to one extent or another, but the kinds of exposure I had to HTML were more similar to this assessment - I didn't see how it was possible to make a dynamic site with lots of elements come together with just HTML. Previously, I thought that's where Java came in, but now I'm appreciating the actual role of Java as a kind of "translator" between the front end and the back end - I was wondering how while loops and polymorphism turns an early 90s-looking blog page into a dynamic site like Youtube, and I guess the simple answer is that it doesn't, but it facilitates interaction between the end user and the trove of data the user is trying to reach.
